## Requirement Analysis in Software Development

The purpose of this repository is to write is to document, analyze and structure requirements.
Here i will write the detailed blueprint of the requirement analysis phase for booking management system.

## What is Requirement Analysis?

- This is a critcal phase where the project teams gathers and analyzes and the defines the requiremnts of the software that would be developed.

## Why is Requirement Analysis Important?
- It is important because it clariies what the stakeholders expect from the software. This also will reduce ambiguity and reduce waste of time as the software developers target their time to accomplish the needs of the stakeholders.
- Requirement analysis helps in clarifying the scope of the project, which in turns prevents scope creeping.
- Since it clarifies what the stakeholders want and need, this helps in getting an estimated cost of the project, the resources need and the estimated time of completion of the project."
- Requirement analysis ensures that the final product is in-line with the specified requirements which in turns leads to customers satisfaction.

## Key Activities in Requirement Analysis.
- Requirement Gathering: 
  Interviewing stakeholders gather detailed needs of the stakeholders needs and expectation.
  Questioner or surveys is a way of collecting from a larger audience.
  workshops is another way for software developers discuss and gather requirement.
  Observing end-users in their working enviroment to understand their needs.
  Documenting and review ing exiting documentation and systems to understand current functionalities and requirements.
- Requirement Elicitation: 
  Brainstorming is conducting brainstorming sessions to generate ideas and gather requirement.
  Holding group meeting with stakeholders to focus on gathering detailed requirements.
  Prototyping: Creating prototypes to help stakeholders visualize the system and refine their requirements
- Requirement Documentation:
  Creating a detailed specification document that list all functional and non-functional requirement.
  Write user stories to describe functionalities from the user's perspective.
  Using case diagrams to show interations between users and the system.
- Requirement Analysis and Modeling:
  Prioritze requirements based on their importance and impact on the project.
  Asses the feasibility of requirements in the terms of technical, financial and time constraints.
  Creating models like data flow diagram and entity-relationship diagrams to visualize and analyze requirements
- Requirement Validation:
Rewviewing the documents requirements with stakesholders to ensure accurancy and completeness.
Defining clearly the acceptance criteria for each requirement to ensure they meet the expected standards.
Establishing traceability matrices to ensure all requirements are addressed during development and testing.
